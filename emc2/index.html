<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jur1st/EMC-2">Find the data on
Github</a></p>
<p>Hey there, and welcome to the EMC-2 Sample Dataset, a little project
I’ve been cooking up to scratch an itch that’s been bugging me (and
probably you) for well over a decade.</p>
<p>I’ve been in the litigation and eDiscovery trenches since passing the
bar, and in all that time, I’ve never come across a public dataset that
really hits the spot for testing, demoing, or just playing around with
eDiscovery and digital forensics tools. Sure, we’ve all used the Enron
set, but let’s be real - it’s showing its age, and we’re all a bit tired
of it. (Pour one out for Andy Zipper.)</p>
<p>So, I decided to create something new. Something that tells a story.
Something that’s manageable, yet complex enough to be interesting. And
yeah, something that’s actually kind of fun to work with. Welcome to the
Ellingson Mineral Company (EMC-2) dataset.</p>
<h2 id="why-emc-2">Why EMC-2?</h2>
<p>Look, we all know the Enron dataset. It’s been the workhorse of
eDiscovery for years. But here’s the thing - our tools have evolved, our
needs have changed, and frankly, we deserve better source material.
Here’s why EMC-2 might just be the refresh you’ve been waiting for:</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>It tells a story: Unlike the Enron emails, which can feel like
reading someone else’s grocery lists out of context, EMC-2 has a
narrative. You can actually follow what’s going on, which makes it great
for testing tools that need to piece together a coherent timeline or
spot key events.</li>
<li>It’s manageable: At around 200 documents, it’s big enough to be
meaningful but small enough that you can actually review it yourself.
Perfect for comparing your work to what your shiny new AI tool spits
out.</li>
<li>It’s got range: Emails, sure, but also chat logs, voicemails, and
more. Because modern investigations aren’t just about emails
anymore.</li>
<li>It’s synthetic: No ethical quandaries about using real people’s
private data. Analyze away without worry.</li>
<li>It’s got easter eggs: There might be a prize in it for you if you
dig deep enough. Just saying.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dataset-contents">Dataset Contents</h2>
<p>Alright, let’s break down what you’re getting in this digital goodie
bag:</p>
<h3 id="custodians">Custodians</h3>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Hal Benson (CEO) (I swear I didn’t guide the AI to this name)</li>
<li>Dr. Sarah Chen</li>
<li>Eugene Belford</li>
<li>Dade Murphy</li>
<li>Margo Wallace</li>
<li>Kate Libby</li>
<li>Richard Gill</li>
<li>Jennifer Mack</li>
<li>jur1st</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="document-types">Document Types</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Emails (with attachments, because who doesn’t love
attachments?)</li>
<li>Internal memos and reports</li>
<li>Chat logs</li>
<li>Voicemail transcripts</li>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>News articles</li>
<li>Technical specs</li>
<li>Financial spreadsheets</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
<li>System logs</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole shebang spans from about October 15 to October 25, 1995.
Why 1995? Let’s just say I might have been inspired by a certain movie.
But don’t worry, you don’t need to know the film to appreciate the
dataset. It’s a self-contained story of corporate shenanigans, cyber
threats, and the digital equivalent of “who dunnit?”</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-data">How to Use This Data</h2>
<p>The envisioned use is to take the data, feed it through the data
analysis tool of your choice, and then play with it. I’ve processed the
full set without processing errors, although there are a couple of files
which may appear corrupt or strange.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-things-are-inside-the-data">What Kind of Things are
Inside the Data?</h2>
<p>At the most basic level, this might be one of the most bizarre
expressions of what I suppose is categorized as fan fiction of sorts but
expressed through the most soul-crushing medium imaginable…someone
else’s email. Think of it as a short story told in a non-traditional
medium if nothing else, and you don’t need to know a darn thing about
the movie to find it a quick, compelling, and dense narrative to pull
facts and details from.</p>
<p>There are references and easter eggs that were intentional and
unintentional. There’s also something of a golden ticket that’s stored
inside here. If you find it, you let me know, and you may be
immortalized on a wall of fame. First come, first served. In-person
turn-ins might receive prizes and certainly will receive a high
five.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-and-known-issues">Limitations and Known Issues</h2>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>This is a small set of documents (at this point), so it’s probably
not suited for much extrapolation of a predictive model at scale. If it
is, someone’s welcome to correct me, but making something that is
statistically defensible is not the intention.</li>
<li>The types of native files currently are limited to plain text,
though that also remains the current state of the art for most
legal-specific tools I’ve taken a look at so far.</li>
<li>Metadata for CSV and TXT documents presently have no time metadata,
which impacts the set’s ability to sort chronologically within
days.</li>
<li>While this got seeded with things from the movie, this is not and
isn’t intended to be some kind of detailed stand-in. We get broad arcs,
main characters, motivations, that kind of thing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>The dataset was implemented using a combination of human creativity
and AI assistance:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Initial taxonomies of different elements of the universe that exists
in the seminal 1995 film, Hackers, at first as kind of a gag. Then the
results started coming out and things escalated to sciencey things
quickly.</li>
<li>AI models were used to expand on these outlines, generating
consistent and varied content.</li>
<li>Human review and editing ensured quality, coherence, and adherence
to the storyline.</li>
<li>Technical details (e.g., code snippets, log files) were
double-checked for accuracy along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>This hybrid approach allowed us to create a dataset that combines the
creativity and nuance of human-generated content with the scale and
consistency made possible by AI.</p>

M,

I&#39;ve submitted my resignation. Two weeks from now, we&#39;ll be sipping mai tais on a beach while Ellingson burns. Make sure everything is in place on your end.

Remember, if anyone gets suspicious, you know nothing. As far as you&#39;re concerned, I&#39;m leaving for a better opportunity elsewhere.

<p>If you enjoy this or find it useful, let me know by dropping me a
line over email (john at john-benson dot com) and letting me know what
you do with it. Heck if you want to take the concept and run with it on
your own that’s fine too. If nothing else this proves that there’s no
darn reason that we need search or summarize Andy Fastow’s email or
scratch your head Jeb(!)’s use of “FUP” as an abbreviation for
follow-up. To paraphrase the last best hope we had before this at
solving this problem…please clap? 👏</p>
