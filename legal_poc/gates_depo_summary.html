    <h2>Deponent Demeanor</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gates often provided lengthy, technical responses that sometimes avoided directly answering the question [p.39-42]</li>
        <li>He frequently claimed lack of recollection or questioned the precise meaning of terms used in questions [p.165-170]</li>
        <li>There were instances where Gates appeared to be argumentative or evasive, particularly when pressed on specific details of emails or statements attributed to him [p.189-195]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Heated Exchanges</h2>
    <p>There were multiple instances where the questioning attorneys, particularly David Boies, had to repeatedly ask the same question due to Gates' indirect answers. For example:</p>
    <p>Boies: "Do you have any doubt that the publication of this statement attributed to you in The Financial Times adversely affected Netscape's business prospects?"</p>
    <p>Gates: (After several evasive responses) "I told you before I'm not aware of any effect on Netscape's business prospects by that statement."</p>
    <p>Boies: (Rephrasing and asking again) "Do you have any doubt that there were such effects; that is, do you have any doubt that regardless of whether you can identify them as you sit here now and tell me what they are, do you have any doubt that your being said to have said these words hurt Netscape's business prospects?"</p>
    <p>This pattern of questioning and evasive answering occurred multiple times throughout the deposition [p.194-195].</p>
