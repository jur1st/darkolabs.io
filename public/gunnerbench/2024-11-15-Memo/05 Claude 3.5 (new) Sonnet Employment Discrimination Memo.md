Re:      Sarah Chen v. TechFlow Solutions - Employment Discrimination, Trade Secrets, and Non-Compete Analysis

QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. Under applicable federal and state law, what are the viable discrimination claims available to Sarah Chen against TechFlow Solutions, considering the evidence of systematic gender discrimination and retaliation?

2. Is TechFlow's non-compete agreement enforceable given California's prohibition on non-compete agreements and the multi-jurisdictional nature of the employment relationship?

3. What exposure does TechFlow face regarding Sarah's documentation of AI bias issues, and what counterclaims might they pursue regarding alleged trade secret misappropriation?

BRIEF ANSWER

1. Sarah has strong gender discrimination and retaliation claims under both Title VII and California's FEHA, supported by substantial direct and statistical evidence. The timing and circumstances of her termination create a compelling retaliation claim.

2. The non-compete agreement is likely unenforceable under California law (Business and Professions Code ยง 16600), despite Minnesota operations, due to the California choice of law provision and strong public policy against non-competes.

3. Sarah's documentation of AI bias likely qualifies for whistleblower protection under federal and state law. While TechFlow may pursue trade secret claims, Sarah's documentation appears primarily focused on discriminatory practices rather than proprietary information.
