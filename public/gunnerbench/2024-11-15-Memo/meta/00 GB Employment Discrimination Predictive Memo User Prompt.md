Hey, we've got a complex one that just landed. Sarah Chen, a senior software architect specializing in AI/ML, came in about TechFlow Solutions. This has everything - discrimination, trade secrets, AI ethics, non-compete issues - and a jurisdictional maze to navigate.

Let me download what we learned in our two-hour intake:

TechFlow's headquartered in Palo Alto but runs a major R&D facility in Minneapolis where Sarah was based. She joined in 2020 as their first remote hire during COVID, leading their AI bias detection team. Her employment agreement has California choice of law provisions and a two-year non-compete covering Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas. The agreement also has specific confidentiality provisions about their "TechFlow Intelligence Suite" - their flagship AI product.

The discrimination angle is solid. Since 2021, Sarah's been passed over three times for the Principal Architect role. They hired Mark Stevens (2021), Dave Johnson (2022), and Pete Williams (2023) - all external hires with 5-7 years less experience. We've got emails from her team lead, Mike Davidson, telling HR that "cultural fit is crucial for leadership" and that Sarah's "aggressive technical opinions" made her "not ready" for advancement. The smoking gun is a private Slack channel called "TF-Architects-After-Hours" where Mike and other male leaders shared memes about women in tech and made comments about "emotional decision-making" in code reviews.

The numbers back her up. Jennifer Martinez in HR (who's willing to be a witness) privately shared data showing female engineers make 15-20% less than male peers. Of 89 technical leads company-wide, only 4 are women. All 12 principal architects are men.

Sarah filed a detailed HR complaint on September 15, 2023. The "investigation" was conducted by Bradley Thompson, Mike's former roommate from Stanford, now Deputy General Counsel. He interviewed Mike on September 20, closed the investigation on September 23. No other witnesses contacted.

Here's where it gets technically interesting - Sarah's team discovered TechFlow's AI recruitment tool was showing strong bias against candidates with women's colleges on their resumes. Further testing revealed their loan assessment algorithm was flagging female small business owners as "higher risk" based on gender-correlated data points. Sarah documented this in a January 5, 2024 report to Chief Technology Officer Amy Martinez (one of two female executives, who's apparently also leaving next month). She included proof-of-concept fixes and recommended immediate client notifications.

Three weeks later, January 29, Sarah's terminated for "performance issues" and "declining collaboration scores." This despite her 2023 Q3 review showing she exceeded expectations in 11/12 categories. Her final project - a bias detection module for financial services clients - is now being marketed by TechFlow as "breakthrough technology."

Before leaving, Sarah downloaded emails, Slack messages, and her discrimination report onto a thumb drive. She also has screenshots of the biased AI test results and salary data Jennifer shared. TechFlow claims she took their client encryption protocols and pricing algorithm documentation. They're threatening an immediate injunction because she's in final talks with MinnesoTech - they're offering her $275,000 plus equity to lead their new AI ethics division.

The industry context is crucial. The SEC is investigating AI bias in financial services. California's new pay transparency law just hit TechFlow with reporting requirements. MinnesoTech just won a $50M federal contract that TechFlow lost, partly due to diversity metrics.

Damages-wise: She's got therapy records since October, documenting anxiety and depression. Base salary was $225,000 plus $180,000 in RSUs vesting monthly. MinnesoTech's offering $275,000 base, $200,000 sign-on, plus equity - but they need an answer by month-end.

Two more things: We've got declarations from three former female employees about similar experiences, and Sarah recorded a Zoom call where Mike admitted the promotion decisions were "influenced by team dynamics and culture fit."

EEOC filing deadline's coming up, and TechFlow's counsel (Morrison & Foerster) is hinting at a TRO in California. They've also sent preservation notices to MinnesoTech.

What's your take on this? I need a comprehensive strategy here - jurisdiction, discrimination claims, this trade secret threat, and maybe something creative with the AI bias angle.
