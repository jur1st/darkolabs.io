Re:      Chen v. TechFlow Solutions - Discrimination, Trade Secrets, and AI Ethics

**Question(s) Presented**

1. Can Sarah Chen establish a prima facie case of discrimination against TechFlow Solutions under California law, given the company's choice of law provisions and her employment in Minnesota?
2. Does the evidence support a claim of trade secret misappropriation by TechFlow, and can they obtain an injunction against Sarah Chen?
3. How can Sarah Chen leverage the AI bias angle to support her claims and potentially create a novel cause of action?

**Brief Answer**

Based on the facts, Sarah Chen has a strong case for discrimination under California law, given the company's choice of law provisions and the evidence of discriminatory practices. The trade secret misappropriation claim by TechFlow appears weak, as Sarah Chen has only taken documents related to her own work and discrimination claims. The AI bias angle provides a unique opportunity for Sarah Chen to argue that TechFlow's biased AI systems perpetuated discriminatory practices, potentially creating a novel cause of action.
