            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initial Questioning Strategy</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focused on establishing Microsoft's market position and Gates' role</li>
                        <li>Used broad, open-ended questions about Microsoft's products and market share</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gates' Initial Responses</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provided cautious, often vague answers</li>
                        <li>Frequently claimed lack of specific knowledge about market share figures</li>
                        <li>Example: When asked about Microsoft's market share, Gates stated, "There's not some unified effort to do that" (p. 29, ln. 23-24)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                                <li>Suggested Microsoft's market share for x86 OS was over 95%</li>
                                <li>Gates disputed the accuracy: "Well, piracy alone is greater than 5 percent" (p. 32, ln. 11-12)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emerging Patterns</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gates consistently challenged the precision of questions</li>
                        <li>Attorneys began to press for more specific answers</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Focused on Microsoft's browser strategy and the concept of "killer apps"</li>
                        <li>Introduced more specific exhibits and internal documents</li>

                        <li>Continued to dispute characterizations of Microsoft's strategies</li>
                    </ul>

                                <li>Gates provided detailed technical explanations, possibly to demonstrate expertise and control the narrative</li>
                            </ul>

                    <strong>Notable Exchange</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>When pressed on the definition of "killer app," Gates insisted: "It means a popular application" (p. 25, ln. 8), resisting implications about driving hardware or OS sales</li>
                    </ul>

        <h2>Analysis of Gates' Response Patterns and Their Evolution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initial Caution to Increased Technicality</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Early responses were brief and often claimed lack of knowledge</li>
                    <li>As questioning progressed, Gates provided more technical, detailed answers, particularly about OS features</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Definition Challenging</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the deposition, Gates frequently disputed the meaning of terms</li>
                    <li>This tactic became more pronounced in later sessions, especially regarding "Internet software" and "memorandum vs. e-mail"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Selective Recall</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gates often claimed not to remember specific details, especially about meetings or decisions</li>
                    <li>This pattern remained consistent but became more noticeable when discussing Netscape meetings</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Contextualizing Statements</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>In later sessions, Gates increasingly insisted on providing context for his statements</li>
                    <li>Example: "I think it mischaracterizes what I said completely to say that I'm just suggesting it. That's really quite a misstatement" (p. 157, ln. 14-16)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tangential Responses</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>As questioning became more pointed, Gates' answers often became longer and less directly responsive</li>
                    <li>This led to multiple instances of attorneys moving to strike answers as nonresponsive</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Key Exhibits and Their Impact on Testimony</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Exhibit 338: "x86 OS Analysis for Fiscal Year '96"</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact: Set the tone for Gates' disputations of market share figures</li>
                    <li>Led to discussions about piracy and alternative OS providers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exhibit 345: "The Internet Tidal Wave" memo</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact: Crucial in establishing Microsoft's early recognition of the Internet's importance</li Continuing from the previous section:

                <ul>
                    <li>Gates struggled to reconcile this memo with public statements downplaying the Internet's significance</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exhibit 351: Netscape meeting e-mails</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact: Highlighted Gates' distance from key competitive discussions</li>
                    <li>Led to some of the most contentious exchanges about Gates' knowledge and involvement</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exhibits 355, 364, 356: Media articles</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact: Forced Gates to address discrepancies between public statements and internal strategies</li>
                    <li>Resulted in extended discussions about the meaning and context of Gates' quotes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Exhibit 354: "Some thoughts on Netscape" e-mail</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Impact: Directly contradicted Gates' claims about the importance of browser market share</li>
                    <li>Led to detailed questioning about Microsoft's competitive intent</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Technical Discussions and Legal Implications</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Operating System Components (p. 13-15):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gates provided detailed explanations of OS features</li>
                    <li>Legal Implication: Established Microsoft's broad definition of an operating system, potentially justifying the inclusion of browser functionality</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Browser Integration (p. 239-240):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gates insisted browser integration was a natural OS evolution</li>
                    <li>Legal Implication: Central to the question of whether bundling IE was an anticompetitive action</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Revenue Models (p. 247-248):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discussions of advertising and partnership revenues from browsers</li>
                    <li>Legal Implication: Relevant to understanding Microsoft's motivations for browser development and distribution</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The Gates deposition revealed a complex interplay between technical discussions, competitive strategies, and legal maneuvering. Gates' testimony evolved from initially cautious and vague responses to more technical and contextual answers as the questioning progressed. The deposition highlighted significant tensions between Microsoft's public statements and internal communications, particularly regarding the company's browser strategy and competition with Netscape.</p>
        <p>Key turning points included the introduction of the "Internet Tidal Wave" memo, which established Microsoft's early recognition of the Internet's importance, and the discussions of the 1995 Netscape meetings, which Gates claimed limited knowledge of. The contrast between Gates' public statements and internal documents became a focal point, leading to some of the most contentious exchanges.</p>
        <p>Throughout the deposition, Gates employed a consistent strategy of challenging definitions, providing technical details, and insisting on context for his statements. This approach often led to lengthy, tangential responses and frustrated the questioning attorneys. The deposition ultimately painted a picture of a company grappling with rapid technological change while trying to maintain its dominant market position, raising significant questions about the line between competitive business practices and potentially anticompetitive behavior.</p>
