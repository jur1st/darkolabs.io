darkolabs.io is where I share my work in coding, AI research, and related resources. Here, you'll find my latest projects, insights into artificial intelligence, and practical tools like prompts and synthetic datasets. This site is for developers, researchers, and anyone intrigued by the evolving landscape of technology.

At the core of my work is a commitment to transparency and open research in AI. Projects like my practical legal benchmark and synthetic dataset for evaluating litigation tools exemplify this approach. These resources aim to enhance the assessment and development of AI systems in legal contexts. All non-code work on this site is available under a Creative Commons Attribution license, with code published under a similar open-source license. By making these tools and datasets freely accessible, I hope to contribute to the responsible advancement of AI technology and foster collaboration within the community.
